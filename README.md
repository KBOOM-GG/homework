# Homework Project: React Native App with Sliding Menu and API Integration
## Objective
The goal of this project is to assess your React Native and Expo skills by creating a mobile application that replicates a design from a provided Figma page. The project will require you to implement a sliding menu and fetch data from an API endpoint with a hardcoded response.

## Requirements
1. Environment Setup: Set up a new Expo project.
2. Figma Design: Implement the design provided in the Figma page. Pay close attention to dimensions, colors, and fonts.
3. Sliding Menu: Implement a menu that slides in from the left side of the screen when activated.
    - The menu should contain buttons.
    - The sliding menu should be hidden by default and should slide in when a user performs a left-to-right slide gesture.
    - While the menu is activated, a blur effect should be applied to the background content.
4. API Endpoint: Create a mock API endpoint that returns hardcoded data for the buttons (e.g., button names, associated icons, etc.).
Use this data to populate the buttons in the sliding menu.
5. Code Quality: Your code should be well-organized and commented where necessary.
## Technical Stack
- React Native
- Expo
- TypeScript
## Deliverables
1. A GitHub repository containing your Expo project.
2. A README.md file with:
    - Setup instructions.
    - Explanation of design decisions and trade-offs made.
    - Any additional libraries or tools used.
## Evaluation Criteria
- **Fidelity to Figma Design**: How closely does your implementation match the provided Figma design?
- **Functionality**: Does the menu slide in and out as expected? Is the blur effect correctly applied?
- **API Integration**: Is the hardcoded API endpoint correctly implemented? Are the buttons populated with this data?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code well-structured, clean, and well-commented?
## Submission Deadline
Please submit your project before the deadline discussed with the Team.
